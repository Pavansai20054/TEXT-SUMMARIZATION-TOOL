Okay, let's delve into the world of AI agents and provide detailed information about them.

AI Agents: Autonomous Entities in Intelligent Environments
At its core, an AI Agent is an entity that perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon that environment through actuators. This simple definition belies a complex field of study that explores how artificial entities can exhibit intelligent, goal-directed, and often autonomous behavior. AI agents are fundamental to the study and develop...

## âœ¨ **Summary**
```text
AI agents are fundamental to the study and development of artificial intelligence, serving as the building blocks for systems that can operate in dynamic, uncertain, and complex worlds. Environments can be anything from a simple grid world in a game to the complex, real-world environment of a self-driving car, or even a digital environment like the internet for a web crawler. The agent operates in a cycle: it perceives the environment, the agent function processes the perception to decide on an action, and the agent executes that action through its actuators, which changes the environment, leading to the next perception. Model-Based Reflex Agents: These agents maintain an internal state about the environment because the current perception alone is insufficient to make a good decision (i.e., the environment is partially observable). The agent function uses the current perception and the internal model of the world to choose an action.
